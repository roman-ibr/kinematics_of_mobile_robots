# Kinematics of Mobile Robots

Translation and rotation and their applications on the motion of wheeled robots are shown in the simulated robot environment: 
* Rigid-Body Motions
* Kinematics for Non-Holonomic Robots
* Kinematics for Holonomic Robots
* Kinematic Control

A project of autonomous floor cleaning with TurtleBot robot shows applications of all above-mentioned topics.
